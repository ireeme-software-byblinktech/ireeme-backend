---

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- Docker Desktop running
- npm

---

## First-Time Setup

### 1. Clone and install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Create your `.env` file

Copy the example and fill in values (defaults work for local dev out of the box):

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

The `.env` already has working local values. The only thing you may want to change is the JWT secrets for your own dev environment. Everything else connects to the Docker containers.

### 3. Start all infrastructure containers

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This starts:

| Container | Port | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `blink-postgres` | `5432` | PostgreSQL database |
| `blink-redis` | `6379` | Redis |
| `blink-pgadmin` | `5050` | pgAdmin web UI |
| `blink-minio` | `9000` (API) / `9001` (console) | Local S3 storage |
| `blink-mailhog` | `1025` (SMTP) / `8025` (inbox UI) | Email catcher |

### 4. Generate Prisma client

```bash
npm run db:generate
```

### 5. Run database migrations

```bash
npm run db:migrate
```

When prompted for a migration name, enter something like `init`.

### 6. Seed the super admin

```bash
npm run db:seed
```

This creates the super admin account using `SUPER_ADMIN_EMAIL` and `SUPER_ADMIN_PASSWORD` from your `.env`.

### 7. Create the MinIO bucket

1. Open `http://localhost:9001`
2. Log in: username `blink_minio_key`, password `blink_minio_secret_2025`
3. Create a bucket named `blink-campus-files`

### 8. Start the API server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The API is now running at `http://localhost:3000/api/v1`

Swagger docs: `http://localhost:3000/api/docs`

## Architecture — Request Flow

Every API call passes through all 7 stages in sequence:

```
Client Request
 │
 ▼
Rate Limiter (Redis)
 │ 429 Too Many Requests if limit exceeded
 ▼
JWT Validation
 │ 401 Unauthorized if token missing or invalid
 ▼
Role Check (RBAC)
 │ 403 Forbidden if role not permitted
 ▼
School Scoping (TenantMiddleware)
 │ Injects schoolId from JWT into every request
 ▼
Controller
 │ Parses and validates input via DTOs
 ▼
Service → Repository → Database
 │ Business logic + Prisma queries
 │ Every query filtered by schoolId
 ▼
Response returned to client
```

## Authentication Flow

```
POST /auth/login  →  { accessToken }  +  refresh_token (httpOnly cookie)
                          ↓ (expires in 15m)
POST /auth/refresh  →  new { accessToken }  +  new refresh_token cookie
                          ↓ (when done)
POST /auth/logout  →  blacklists JTI in Redis, clears cookie
```

Access tokens are short-lived (15 min). Refresh tokens last 7 days and are stored as bcrypt hashes in the database. On logout, the access token's JTI is stored in Redis with a TTL equal to its remaining lifetime.

---

## Multi-Tenancy (School Isolation)

Every request is automatically scoped to the user's school:

1. `TenantMiddleware` extracts `schoolId` from the JWT and attaches it to the request
2. Every repository extends `BaseRepository` which has a `scopeToSchool()` helper
3. All Prisma queries include `where: { schoolId }` — a student from School A can never see School B data
4. Wrong school data returns `404`, not `403` — to avoid leaking that the resource exists

---

## Rate Limiting

| Endpoint | Limit | Window |
|---|---|---|
| `POST /auth/login` | 10 attempts | 15 min (then IP locked) |
| All other endpoints | 300 requests | 60 seconds |

Limits are enforced via Redis and configured through `RATE_LIMIT_TTL` and `RATE_LIMIT_MAX` in `.env`.

---

## Dev Tools

| Tool | URL | Credentials |
|---|---|---|
| Swagger API Docs | http://localhost:3000/api/docs | — |
| pgAdmin | http://localhost:5050 | `admin@blink.dev` / `admin` |
| MinIO Console | http://localhost:9001 | `blink_minio_key` / `blink_minio_secret_2025` |
| MailHog Inbox | http://localhost:8025 | — |
| Prisma Studio | run `npm run db:studio` | — |

---

## Docker Commands

```bash
# Start all containers
docker-compose up -d

# Stop all containers
docker-compose down

# View logs for a specific container
docker-compose logs -f blink-redis
docker-compose logs -f blink-postgres

# Restart a single container
docker-compose restart blink-redis

# Wipe everything including volumes (full reset)
docker-compose down -v
```

---

## Running Tests

```bash
npm run test:run           # Run all unit tests once
npm run test:watch         # Watch mode during development
npm run test:cov           # Coverage report

# Integration tests (requires running DB + Redis)
npx jest --testPathPattern=integration
```

### Integration Test Coverage

| Flow | What is tested |
|---|---|
| Auth | Login, refresh, logout, token blacklist after logout |
| Students | CRUD, role guards, school isolation (404 cross-school) |
| Assignments + Grades | Create → submit → grade → appeal → resolve flow |

All integration tests verify:
- Correct HTTP status codes
- `requestId` present in all error responses
- School isolation — token from School A cannot access School B data

---

## Database Commands

```bash
# Generate Prisma client after schema changes
npm run db:generate

# Create and apply a new migration
npm run db:migrate

# Open visual database browser
npm run db:studio

# Reset DB and re-run all migrations (destructive)
npx prisma migrate reset
```

---

## Logs

Winston writes structured JSON logs to:
- `logs/combined.log` — all levels
- `logs/error.log` — errors only
- Console — pretty-printed in development

---

## Security Notes

- Never commit `.env` — it is in `.gitignore`
- JWT secrets must be at least 32 characters
- `AWS_ENDPOINT` must be removed when deploying to production (so the SDK uses real AWS)
- `BCRYPT_ROUNDS=12` is the minimum recommended for production
- All file uploads should be renamed to UUIDs before storage (never use original filenames)
